# `🧹` Sweeper
A tiny Python application made to clear cache directories. 🧹

## `❓` What is Sweeper?
Sweeper is a **REALLY** simple CLI tool for cleaning up your projects directory.

## `🔨` Why did I make this?
I rely on USBs to store my projects, allowing me to work from anywhere. However, this becomes an issue when I have large packages and dependencies installed that I don't need all the time. That's why I created Sweeper, to easily clean up my drives.

## `🔧` Installation
Copy `sweeper.py` to your PC (I recommend storing it in your home directory) then install our dependencies with `pip install rich httpx json5`, and boom you're ready to start sweeping!

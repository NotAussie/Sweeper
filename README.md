# Sweeper
A tiny Python application made to clear cache directories. ðŸ§¹

# What is Sweeper?
Sweeper is a **REALLY** simple CLI tool for cleaning up your projects directory.

# Why did I make this?
I rely on USBs to store my projects, allowing me to work from anywhere. However, this becomes an issue when I have large packages and dependencies installed that I don't need all the time. That's why I created Sweeper, to easily clean up my drives.
